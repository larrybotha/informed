# Async Validation

** Note: This is in beta and is subject to change! **

Async validation can be achieved by passing an asyncValidation function to the input.
Below is an example form that has validation functions. The synchronous function defined
will return an error when the input is empty, and nothing otherwise. The second asynchronous
function defined will, after two seconds, resolve an error or nothing depending on what is typed.
We pass these validation functions to the username input and validation will **occur on submission**.

**Try clicking the submit button WITH AN EMPTY FIELD! and see what happens:**

<!-- STORY -->

What just happened? When you clicked on the submit button the synchronous
validation function was triggered. Because the field was empty ( if you left it empty )
it failed synchronous validation, and therefore did not run the async validation or
actually submit the form.

**Get rid of the synchronous error by typing "FooBar" in the username field, then
click the submit button again, WAIT TWO SECONDS, and see what happens:**

The form submitted!! Why? Because both our synchronous and asynchronous validation passed.
Lets make our asynchronous validation fail!

**Ok now type "billy" into the field, click on the submit button, and wait two more seconds.**

The form did NOT submit!! Why? Because asynchronous validation failed.

**Ok now type "reject" into the field, click on the submit button, and wait two more seconds.**

The form did not submit because the "apicall" to validate failed.

```jsx
import { Form, Text } from 'informed';

const validate = username =>
  !username || username.trim() === ''
    ? 'Username is a required field'
    : undefined;

const ExampleForm = () => {
  const apiRef = useRef();

  const asyncValidate = username =>
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      apiRef.current.validating();
      setTimeout(() => {
        // Simulate username check
        if (['joe', 'tanner', 'billy', 'bob'].includes(username)) {
          apiRef.current.validated('username', 'That username is taken');
          return resolve();
        }
        // Simulate request faulure
        if (username === 'reject') {
          apiRef.current.validated('username', 'Unable to validate username.');
          return reject();
        }
        // Sumulate username success check
        apiRef.current.validated('username');
        return resolve();
      }, 2000);
    });

  return (
    <Form apiRef={apiRef} onSubmit={values => console.log(values)}>
      <Text
        field="username"
        label="Username"
        validate={validate}
        asyncValidate={asyncValidate}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
};
```
